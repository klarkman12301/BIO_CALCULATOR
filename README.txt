We present to you the Bio Calculator developed by Zhumagaliyev Sultan, Aktan Islam and Esmagambetov Makhambet. 
This calculator will show how much you are below or can be above the average height in different countries and also show the average weight.
We also added a bmi calculator to calculate your bmi.
I would also like to add something about the repository to the github. 
The fact is that Makhambet could not commit with us due to the lack of a personal computer. 
However, we did not let him sit back and he wrote the code all this time and thought about it with us and committed from the Sultan's account, 
so we ask you to evaluate his work without commits. By the way, we equally distributed the tasks, 
since we had only one complex class and we added and changed something in turn.
